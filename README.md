This repository contains source files of the tooling I used
during my PhD research and work on the final dissertation.


Viewer application
------------------

To run the Viewer application, install the dependencies specified in the
`requirements.txt` file, then run the `Viewer.py` from `research/` directory.

Alternatively, this can be achieved conveniently with the `tox` command:

```
tox -e streamlit
```
