\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\label{chapter:acknowledgments}

I would like express my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Henryk Maciejewski, for~the~whole his help, not only during my research and redaction of this dissertation, but~also, most importantly, for his assistance in introducing me the University ecosystem and guiding me how to survive in it. After all our countless conversations, I~understand how to continue doing my part well, while still remaining a good and a kind person.

I would like to thank my fiancé, Sylwia, for invaluable support, unlimited patience and especially for believing in~me and not asking about my daily writing progress~;-) I~hope that now we will be able to fully focus on our future adventures together.

I would also like to send my thanks to everyone who made this whole period bearable and kept me sanity during this journey – most importantly: Adrian, Arie, Artur, Arx, Bogna, Daniel, David, Dawid, Ignacio, Karolina, Klaudia, Mateusz, Mike and Piotr. Without You, my motivation would have been lost long ago...

\noindent
To all of You, from the deepest bottom of my heart, \\
Thank You so much! / Dziękuję bardzo! / Tack så mycket!
