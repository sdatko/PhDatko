\section{Measures of outlierness used by OOD detectors}
\label{section:measures}

For quantifying the similarity of a given feature vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to a~specified candidate class $c_T$, represented by a training cluster $T$, we define a measure function $OF(v, T)$ such as that
\begin{equation}
    OF(v, T) : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R},
\end{equation}
i.e., for a given feature vector $v$ of dimension $d$ it assigns a single real number value as an~output. That value can be intuitively interpreted as a~distance of a~given feature vector $v$ from the cluster $T$, hence typically the greater value the more distant the vector is, although this is algorithm-specific and there are known algorithms that present the opposite behavior. The exact formula on how to calculate the output value is also specific to a~particular algorithm – the differences include such factors as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[–] how is the target cluster $T$ being represented?
    \item[–] which metric is used to calculate the distance?
\end{itemize}

It should be noticed that the outlierness measures usually do not define absolutely at which output value the given data vector $v$ shall be marked as an outlier. Hence, the proposed procedure of finding a~threshold value and performing the open-set classification, described in section \ref{section:procedure}.
