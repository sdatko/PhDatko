\chapter{Performance of OOD detectors in~image and text recognition tasks}
\label{chapter:real-data}

In this chapter the results of research conducted on image data and text documents are presented. The performance of popular outlier detection methods is shown when applied to feature spaces generated by various Deep Learning (DL) models. It is shown that the effectiveness of OOD detectors are significantly impacted by the characteristics of the feature spaces generated by deep learning representation techniques. Hence, the~extended way of evaluating the OOD-generalization properties for selected DL-based data representation methods is proposed. The results are introduced as comparison with traditional measures of efficiency, as being used in current literature. In addition, the differences in properties of the feature vectors obtained from various representation techniques are discussed, resulting in a~number of recommendations on the OOD detectors selection.

The described results are base and motivation for further, dedicated publication \cite{Datko-2024} that was prepared and submitted at the same time as this dissertation chapter.
